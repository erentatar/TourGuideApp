    <!-- About Ankara -->
    <string name="city_name">Ankara</string>
    <string name="city_description">
        The city of Ankara lies in the center of Anatolia on the eastern edge of the great, high Anatolian Plateau, at an altitude of 850 meters.
        The province is a predominantly fertile wheat steppe, with forested areas in the north-east. The city was an important cultural, trading,
        and arts center in Roman times, and an important trading center on the caravan route to the east in Ottoman times. It had declined in
        importance by the nineteenth century. It again became an important center when Kemal Atatürk chose it as the base from which to direct the
        War of Independence. By consequence of its role in the war and its strategic position, it was declared the capital of the new Turkish Republic
        on October 13, 1923.
